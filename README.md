Efficient algebraic Time Delay of Arrival (TDoA) algorithms, designed to provide more accurate localizations given fewer datapoints than required for other approaches. Requires just three data points ("nodes") for 2-Dimensional vertexing, and four nodes for 3-Dimensional vertexing. Robust against noisy data.
